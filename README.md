In this lab I learned about visually analyzing planned unit developments in Washington, D.C. using pandas and geopandas. Through the tutorial guide, I read the files in my script as a geodataframe and selected a coordinate reference system. A geometry column was added to the affordable housing dataframe and a join was used to select the PUDs that were specifically affordable housing. Then the dataframe was merged with the crosswalk for zoning categories, the count was printed, and the PUDs were mapped by zoning category. I then exported the created geodataframe as shapefiles and created a web map using Carto.

I had trouble getting file paths to work properly, but thankfully the Slack #tech-problems channel was very patient and helpful! I liked learning about combining and converting data. Pandas and geopandas are very powerful and this was a great way to see their use. It was also neat to learn about an urban development project.
